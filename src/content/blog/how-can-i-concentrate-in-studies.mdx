# How Can I Concentrate on Studying?: Tips to Stay Focused and Productive


As a student, one of the biggest challenges is staying focused and concentrating on your studies. With distractions around every corner - from social media notifications to thoughts about upcoming weekend plans - it can feel nearly impossible to keep your mind on the task at hand sometimes. I've struggled with this myself, but over time I've discovered several effective strategies that help me concentrate better when studying. In this post, I'll share my top tips for improving your concentration and making the most of your study sessions.



## 1. Choose a Distraction-Free Study Environment


First and foremost, it's crucial to set yourself up in a study space that is free of as many distractions as possible. Find a quiet place - whether that's a private room, a library, or just a peaceful corner of your home. Make sure your study area is well-lit, ventilated, and equipped with a comfortable chair and work surface.

 

Remove any potential distractions from your environment:


    - Silence your phone or put it in another room

    - Close unnecessary browser tabs and apps on your computer
  
    - Clear any clutter from your desk

    - If you can't find quiet, consider using earplugs or noise-canceling headphones





By setting up a clean, distraction-free workspace, you'll make it much easier to focus your full attention on your studies.

## 2. Break Tasks into Manageable Chunks


When you have a huge study task looming in front of you, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. That feeling of overwhelm can lead to procrastination and difficulty concentrating. One solution is to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), breaking your study session into focused 25-minute chunks separated by short 5-minute breaks.



Even if you don't follow the Pomodoro Technique to a T, you can still apply the general principle of breaking big tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. Before diving into a big study session, take a few minutes to break the material down into specific chapters, sections, or chunks that you will focus on one at a time. Then work your way through them, pausing for quick breaks between each chunk. You'll be surprised how much easier it feels to concentrate when you're not trying to mentally digest a huge amount of information all at once.



## 3. Make a Study Plan and Schedule


Another way to boost concentration is to make a clear study plan and schedule. When you have a specific agenda in mind for what you need to accomplish, it's easier to keep your focus lasered in on those key priorities.



At the beginning of each week, make a study plan that lists out the specific tasks you need to complete, such as:


    - Read Chapter 5 of textbook

    - Complete problem set #12 

    - Review lecture notes from weeks 3-4

    - Outline essay for History class





Then slot those tasks into your calendar, setting aside dedicated study blocks for each one. Treat those study appointments like any other important meeting or commitment.

 

During each study block, keep that time sacred and completely focused on the task you've assigned for that block. Knowing that you have time set aside for other tasks later will help you concentrate on the one at hand without getting distracted by thoughts of everything else on your plate.



## 4. Leverage Active Recall Strategies


One reason many students struggle to concentrate while studying is that they are using passive study techniques like re-reading notes or highlighting. While these activities might feel productive, they don't actually do much to cement the information in your memory.



Active recall strategies, on the other hand, force you to actively engage with the material and practice retrieving key facts and concepts from memory. By challenging your brain in this way, you'll not only concentrate better in the moment, but also retain more of the information long-term.



Some of my favorite active recall techniques include:


    - Making and using flashcards to test yourself

    - Summarizing key points from memory, without peeking at your notes

    - Teaching concepts to a study partner or classmate
  
    - Completing practice problems or questions





Try swapping out some of your usual passive study activities for active recall and watch your concentration and retention soar. For more active recall strategies, see our post on [evidence-based study techniques](https://productivityprospect.com/active-recall-techniques/).



## 5. Take Effective Breaks


When you're struggling to concentrate, taking more breaks might seem counterintuitive. But the truth is, regular breaks are essential for maintaining focus over a long study session.



The key is to keep your breaks relatively short (around 5-15 minutes), and to use them for truly refreshing activities. Taking a quick walk outdoors, doing some light stretching, or enjoying a healthy snack are all great options. Avoid social media scrolling or other digital distractions that are likely to break your focus.



I find it helpful to use a timer to keep my breaks from stretching too long. I'll often do something physical like walking or stretching for the first half of my break, then use the second half for a mental break like chatting with a friend or listening to a favorite song. Then when the timer goes off, I'm ready to dive back into my studies with renewed concentration.



## 6. Try Focus-Enhancing Study Tools


There are also many great tools and apps designed specifically to help students concentrate while studying. Here are a few of my personal favorites:

While no app is a true substitute for self-discipline, the right tools can make a big difference in your ability to buckle down and concentrate. See [this roundup of our favorite anti-distraction tools](https://productivityprospect.com/anti-distraction-tools/) for more options.



## 7. Fuel Your Brain with Proper Nutrition, Hydration, and Sleep
  

Never underestimate the connection between your physical health and your ability to concentrate. If you're not giving your body the nutrition, hydration, and rest it needs to thrive, your focus will suffer.



Make sure you're:


	- Eating regular, balanced meals with plenty of brain-boosting foods like leafy greens, berries, nuts, and fatty fish

	- Drinking enough water throughout the day (aim for at least 8 glasses)

	- Getting 7-9 hours of high-quality sleep each night

	- Limiting alcohol, excess caffeine, and sugary/processed snacks





It's also a good idea to keep some healthy study snacks on hand to fuel your brain, like fresh fruit, trail mix, or veggies with hummus. Avoid energy drinks or sugary sodas that will lead to a crash later.

  

## 8. Prioritize Your Most Important Work


As a student juggling multiple classes and commitments, it's inevitable that you'll sometimes have more on your plate than you can realistically handle. When that happens, it's important to prioritize the study tasks that will make the biggest impact so you can concentrate on what really matters.



Take a few minutes to list out all of your to-dos, then ruthlessly cut anything that isn't essential. Label each remaining task as either high, medium, or low priority. Then whenever you sit down to study, concentrate your time and energy on knocking out the high-priority items first.

  

Don't be afraid to say no to non-essential activities when you need to focus on studying. Remember: You can have it all, just not all at once. Stay focused on your top academic priorities and save lower-priority activities for when your study load is lighter.



## 9. Find an Accountability Partner


Staying focused while studying can be a lot easier when you have an accountability partner to keep you on track. Find a friend, classmate, or family member who is also working towards academic goals and agree to check in with each other regularly.



You might send each other a quick text each morning with your study goals for the day, then check back in at the end of the day to report on your progress. Or you could try [using an app like Focusmate to schedule virtual coworking sessions](https://zapier.com/blog/accountability-partner/) where you study "alongside" each other on video.



Knowing that you have someone to answer to can be a powerful motivator to stay focused. Plus, celebrating your wins together and encouraging each other through challenging study sessions can make the whole process a lot more fun.



## Conclusion


Learning how to concentrate on studying is an ongoing process that requires practice and patience with yourself. Remember that everyone gets distracted or overwhelmed sometimes - the key is to have an arsenal of tools and techniques to help you refocus when it happens.

  

By setting up a distraction-free environment, breaking tasks into manageable pieces, using active recall strategies, taking effective breaks, and employing other concentration hacks, you can train your brain to stay focused for longer stretches and make your study time much more productive. It won't happen overnight, but with time and consistent effort, you can master the skill of deep concentration and crush your academic goals.



## FAQs About How to Concentrate on Studying


### 1. How can I force myself to concentrate while studying?


Rather than trying to "force" concentration, which can lead to frustration, try implementing focus-friendly strategies like the ones outlined in this post. Set up a clean study space, use active recall techniques, take regular breaks, and prioritize your most important work. With practice, concentration will start to come more naturally.



### 2. How many hours a day should I study?


The ideal amount of study time varies from person to person. As a general rule, aim for 2-3 hours of focused study time per day, broken up into chunks of 25-45 minutes with short breaks in between. Experiment to find the daily study schedule that works best for you and don't compare yourself to others.



### 3. Is it better to study in the morning or at night?


There's no one right answer to this - it depends on your individual chronotype (natural sleep-wake cycle). Some people concentrate best in the morning when they're feeling refreshed, while others hit their stride later in the day. Pay attention to when you tend to be most focused and productive and align your study schedule with those natural energy peaks when possible.



### 4. What are the best foods to eat while studying?


To fuel your brain for concentration, aim for balanced study snacks that include:

	- Complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for steady energy

	- Lean proteins like nuts, eggs, or chickpeas to promote alertness  

	- Healthy fats from sources like avocados, olive oil, or fatty fish to support brain function




Stay hydrated with plenty of water and limit sugary, processed snacks as much as possible. For a list of the top brain-boosting foods for studying, check out [this post](https://productivityprospect.com/best-brain-foods-for-studying/).
