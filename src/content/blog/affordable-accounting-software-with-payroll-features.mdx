## Frequently Asked Questions


### What is the most cost-effective accounting software for a startup with less than 10 employees?

For startups with a small team, I highly recommend Wave Accounting. It offers free accounting features with a reasonable payroll add-on cost. The platform is user-friendly and provides essential features needed for small business management.



### How much should I expect to spend monthly on accounting software with payroll features?

For a small business with 5-10 employees, you should expect to spend between $70-150 per month for a complete solution including both accounting and payroll features. This typically includes the base subscription and per-employee fees.



### Can I switch accounting software providers after I've started using one?

Yes, you can switch providers, but it requires careful planning. Most modern software offers data migration tools, but I recommend making the switch at the start of a new fiscal year or quarter to minimize disruption to your financial reporting.



### Do I need special training to use accounting software with payroll features?

While most modern accounting software is user-friendly, I recommend taking advantage of available training resources. Many providers offer free training videos, webinars, and documentation. Basic accounting knowledge is helpful but not mandatory for using these systems effectively.
