## Frequently Asked Questions


### How long should each time block be in my schedule?

Time blocks typically range from 15 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the task. For focused work, I recommend 90-minute blocks followed by breaks. For routine tasks, 30-minute blocks often work well. Experiment to find what works best for you.



### Should I time block my entire day, including personal time?

Yes, I recommend blocking out personal time, including meals, exercise, and leisure activities. This ensures a balanced schedule and prevents work from encroaching on personal time. However, maintain flexibility for spontaneity in your personal life.



### What should I do when unexpected tasks disrupt my time blocks?

Build buffer blocks into your schedule to accommodate unexpected tasks. When disruptions occur, decide whether to handle them immediately or reschedule them for your next buffer block. Always maintain some flexibility in your schedule for such situations.



### How often should I review and adjust my time blocking template?

I suggest reviewing your template weekly and making minor adjustments as needed. Conduct a more thorough review monthly to ensure your schedule aligns with your current goals and responsibilities. Be prepared to make major revisions quarterly as your priorities evolve.
