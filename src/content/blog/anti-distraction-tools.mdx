# Anti-Distraction Tools: Staying Focused in a World of Digital Distractions


As someone who works online and is easily distracted by shiny digital things, I'm always on the lookout for tools and strategies to help me stay focused. In this post, I'll share some of the best anti-distraction tools I've found for blocking digital distractions, tracking productivity, and cultivating better focus habits. If you struggle with procrastination and attention issues in our hyper-connected world, read on!



## Why We Get Distracted


Before diving into the tools, it's helpful to understand why we get so easily distracted in the first place. Distractions often arise from a desire to avoid something unpleasant, boring, or difficult. Checking social media or browsing the web provides an easy dopamine hit and escape.



Digital distractions are especially problematic because devices and apps are intentionally designed to be addictive. Bright colors, infinite scrolling, autoplaying videos, and constant notifications exploit psychological vulnerabilities to steal our attention. We're up against armies of programmers and designers using persuasive tech to keep us hooked.



The good news is that we're not powerless. By understanding the causes of distraction, we can select tools and reshape our environment to short-circuit our worst impulses and make focused work the path of least resistance.



## Website and App Blockers


One of the most effective ways to eliminate digital distractions is to use a website or app blocker. These tools restrict access to distracting websites and apps during scheduled focus sessions or work hours. A few of the best:




  - [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) - Block websites, apps, and the internet across all your devices on a schedule.

  [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) - Block websites, apps, and the internet. Offers lockdown modes that can't be disabled.
  - [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) - Open-source app for Mac that lets you block websites for a set amount of time.

  - [Stay Focused](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused&hl=en_US&gl=US) - Simple app and website blocker for Android.



I use [Freedom](https://productivityprospect.com/freedom-app-review/) to block distracting websites and apps across all my devices during work hours. Setting a daily schedule eliminates decision fatigue and prevents me from opening distractions on autopilot. The lockdown modes in Cold Turkey are also great for locking yourself out of distractions completely when you need to get something done.



## Distraction-Free Writing Tools


If you do a lot of writing, using a distraction-free writing tool can provide a serene, minimalist environment for focused work. Most offer a full-screen mode that eliminates other apps, toolbars, notifications and lets you focus solely on your words. Some good options:




  - [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) - Streamlined, minimalist writing app for Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android.

  - [FocusWriter](https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/) - Simple, distraction-free writing environment for Linux, Windows, and Mac. Includes optional typewriter sound effects.
  
  - [OmmWriter](https://ommwriter.com/) - Distraction-free writing app that uses serene backgrounds and audio tracks to aid focus.

  - [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) - Not exclusively a distraction-free tool, but offers a full-screen mode for focusing on your document.



I love the minimal, typewriter-inspired interface of iA Writer for drafting blog posts. Combining it with a website blocker is a powerful combo for deep focus sessions.



## Pomodoro and Time Tracking Apps


The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves working in focused 25-minute intervals broken up by short breaks. Several apps replicate and time this technique:




  - [Pomo Focus](https://pomofocus.io/) - Simple web-based Pomodoro timer.

  - [Tomato Timer](https://tomato-timer.com/) - Web-based Pomodoro timer with fun tomato visuals and sounds.

  - [More Pomodoro Apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-pomodoro-apps/) - Zapier has a great rundown of other Pomodoro app options.



In addition to interval training your focus, tracking your time keeps you accountable and helps identify productivity leaks:




  - [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) - Simple, easy-to-use time tracking app for monitoring your productivity.

  - [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) - Automatic time tracking app that measures how you spend your digital time. Offers detailed reports and tools for blocking distractions.



I like to combine Pomodoro intervals with [Toggl tracking](https://productivityprospect.com/toggl-review/) for focused work sprints. Tracking my time keeps me honest and seeing reports of how much focused work I accomplish is motivating.



## Mindfulness and Digital Wellness Apps


Several apps aim to cultivate mindfulness and more intentional relationships with technology. Building awareness of compulsive device habits is the first step to changing them:




  - [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) - Popular app with guided meditations, breathing exercises, and relaxing soundtracks.

  - [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) - Meditation app with guided mindfulness exercises for managing stress and anxiety.

  - [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) - Unique app that gamifies focused work sessions by planting virtual trees that grow as you focus.
  
  - [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/) - Sleep tracking app that monitors your sleep patterns and wakes you up during light sleep for better energy and focus.



I've found [short meditation sessions](https://productivityprospect.com/mindfulness-exercises-at-work/) with Headspace tremendously helpful in resetting between tasks and meetings during the workday. Building awareness of my agitated, distracted mind makes it easier to catch myself before going down unproductive rabbit holes.



## Browser Add-Ons and Extensions


Several browser add-ons and extensions provide distraction-blocking and digital wellness features:




  - [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) - Hides addictive social media newsfeeds.

  - [Unreader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unreader/cbgadmgpbkfpnmmgmiejppmhoohglfhj?hl=en) - Hides comment sections across the web to minimize rage-scrolling.

  - [DF YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-youtube-distraction-fr/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna?hl=en) - Hides distracting YouTube recommendations, comments, and more.

  - [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) - Limits the amount of time you can spend on distracting websites.

  - [Freedom for Browser](https://freedom.to/freedom-browser) - Blocks and hides distracting websites in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.



I use News Feed Eradicator with great success to hide my Facebook newsfeed, which is the most distracting part of the platform. I still use Facebook for events and messaging, but eliminating the newsfeed removes the temptation to mindlessly scroll. Unreader is also great for hiding rage-inducing comment sections - I can still read articles but skip the infuriating cesspools that follow.



## Notifications and Email Management


Notifications and emails are some of the most pervasive distractions, constantly interrupting focused work to steal our attention. A few tools can help tame the madness:




  - [Slack Notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Guide-to-desktop-notifications) - Slack's robust notification preferences let you pause notifications, set do not disturb hours, and customize which channels and keywords trigger notifications.

  - [Outlook Alerts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-new-message-alert-pop-up-on-or-off-9940c70e-b306-442e-a856-d94b20318481) - Disable or minimize new email pop-ups and alerts in Outlook.
  
  - [Boomerang for Gmail](https://www.boomeranggmail.com/) - Schedule emails, set reminders, and pause your inbox to control when emails appear.

  - [SaneBox](https://www.sanebox.com/) - Advanced email filtering app that automatically sorts emails by importance so you can focus on what matters.



I aggressively prune and customize my [notification settings](https://productivityprospect.com/useful-gmail-settings/) to minimize interruptions - enabling do not disturb hours, unsubscribing from noisy email lists, and turning off pop-ups and badges for non-essential alerts. Boomerang is also great for pausing my inbox during focused work sessions.



## Social Media Filters and Managers


Social media is a double-edged sword - great for connecting with others but toxic for focus and mental health. A few tools can help make social media more intentional and less compulsive:




  - [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) - Hides addictive Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube newsfeeds.

  - [Tidy Twitter](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tidy-twitter) - Browser extension that hides Twitter trends, "who to follow", and other distracting cruft.

  - [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) - Social media management platform that lets you schedule posts in advance and monitor multiple feeds in one place.

  - [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) - Social media management platform for scheduling posts, analyzing performance, and managing multiple accounts.



I've radically [cut back my social media usage](https://productivityprospect.com/how-to-quit-social-media/) and made my remaining time more intentional using tools like News Feed Eradicator and Tidy Twitter. Scheduling posts in advance with Hootsuite also allows me to maintain a social presence without getting sucked into feeds throughout the day.



## Habit Tracking and Goal Setting Apps


Building positive habits and setting clear goals creates a structure for focused work. A few apps can help cultivate discipline and keep you on track:




  - [Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/home) - Habit building app that gamifies your goals and to-do's with in-game rewards and punishments.

  - [StickK](https://www.stickk.com/) - Goal setting platform that leverages the psychology of loss aversion to hold you accountable with real money stakes.

  - [Coach.me](https://www.coach.me/) - Habit tracking app with personal coaching and community support for achieving goals.



I use a combination of [habit tracking spreadsheets and apps](https://productivityprospect.com/best-habit-tracking-apps/) like Habitica to maintain a regular writing habit. Having a system of small, daily goals prevents procrastination and makes productivity automatic.



## Low-Tech Distraction Blockers


Some of the best anti-distraction tools are decidedly low-tech:




  - [Noise-cancelling headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD) - Physical headphones that block out distracting noises and help you focus.

  - [Faraday bag](https://www.amazon.com/Agokey-Cell-Phone-Signal-Blocker/dp/B07KRQJ6DH/) - Bag that blocks wireless signals to your phone, removing the temptation to check it.
  
  - [Internet kill-switch](https://www.fosstodon.org/@amit/109646720763227370) - Physically disconnecting from the internet to do deep work.



I love using my noise-cancelling headphones to create a focused cocoon, especially in noisy environments. I also use an [internet kill-switch](https://amzn.to/3hwfj1O) to physically disconnect for periods of deep work, making it impossible to go online even if I want to.
