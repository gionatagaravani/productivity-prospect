## Frequently Asked Questions


### How long does it typically take to transition to a completely paperless office?

The transition typically takes 2-3 months for a home office, depending on the volume of existing papers and your dedication to the process. I recommend planning for a gradual transition, focusing on one category of documents at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.



### What should I do with important original documents?

Keep original copies of vital documents such as birth certificates, social security cards, and property deeds in a fireproof safe or safety deposit box. While you should have digital copies for easy access, certain legal documents require original physical copies.



### Is it really secure to store sensitive documents in the cloud?

Yes, when proper security measures are implemented. I recommend using reputable cloud storage providers that offer encryption, two-factor authentication, and regular security updates. Additionally, consider using local encrypted storage for highly sensitive documents.



### What's the most cost-effective way to start a paperless office?

Start with a good smartphone scanner app and free cloud storage services like Google Drive or OneDrive. As your needs grow, invest in a quality document scanner and paid cloud storage solutions. This gradual approach helps manage costs while building an efficient system.
