# Seasonal Decluttering Checklist for Every Room: Your Ultimate Guide to a Tidy Home


As someone who's passionate about maintaining an organized living space, I've learned that seasonal decluttering is key to keeping a home that's both functional and peaceful.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How often should I perform a complete house declutter?

I recommend doing a thorough declutter at the start of each season (four times per year). However, maintain regular quick decluttering sessions weekly to prevent overwhelming accumulation.



### What's the best way to start decluttering when feeling overwhelmed?

Start with one small area, like a drawer or shelf, and spend just 15 minutes on it. This builds momentum and confidence. Follow the "one room at a time" rule and avoid trying to tackle everything at once.



### How can I maintain a clutter-free home between seasonal decluttering sessions?

Implement the "one-in-one-out" rule, perform daily five-minute tidying sessions, and use proper storage solutions. Create designated spaces for items and stick to them consistently.



### What should I do with items I'm unsure about keeping?

Use the six-month rule: if you haven't used an item in the last six months (excluding seasonal items), consider donating or selling it. For sentimental items, take photos before letting go if you're struggling with the decision.
