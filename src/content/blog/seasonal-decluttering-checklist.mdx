## Frequently Asked Questions


### How often should I perform a complete seasonal declutter?

I recommend doing a thorough decluttering session at the beginning of each season (four times per year). However, smaller maintenance sessions should be performed weekly or bi-weekly to prevent clutter from accumulating.



### What should I do with sentimental items during decluttering?

For sentimental items, I suggest creating a dedicated "memory box" with limited space. Take photos of items you can't keep, and only preserve the most meaningful pieces. Consider digitizing photos and documents to save physical space while maintaining memories.



### How can I maintain momentum during a decluttering session?

I find the best approach is using the Pomodoro Technique - work in 25-minute focused sessions with 5-minute breaks. Set specific goals for each session, play energizing music, and reward yourself after completing major decluttering milestones.



### What's the best way to prevent clutter from returning after a seasonal declutter?

Implement daily habits like the one-in-one-out rule, designate specific homes for items, and perform regular quick tidying sessions. Additionally, be mindful of new purchases and regularly evaluate whether items truly add value to your life.
