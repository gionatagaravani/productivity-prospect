In today's hyper-connected world, the ability to perform deep work—focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task—has become increasingly rare and increasingly valuable. Here's how to cultivate this crucial skill.

### 2. Embrace Boredom

Train your brain to focus:

### 3. Quit Social Media

Be selective with your tools:
