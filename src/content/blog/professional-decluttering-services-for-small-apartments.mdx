## Frequently Asked Questions


### How long does a professional decluttering service typically take?

The duration varies depending on the size of your apartment and the extent of decluttering needed. For a small apartment, the process typically takes 1-3 sessions, with each session lasting 4-6 hours. Some projects may be completed in a single day, while others might require multiple visits over several weeks.

Before the service, take photos of your space, gather basic cleaning supplies, and mentally prepare to make decisions about your belongings. It's helpful to have some boxes or bags ready for donations and trash. Most importantly, be prepared to be present and involved in the decision-making process.



### Will I be forced to get rid of things I want to keep?

Absolutely not. Professional declutterers are there to guide and support you, not to force decisions. The final choice about what to keep or discard always remains with you. We provide objective input and help you make informed decisions based on your space, lifestyle, and needs.
