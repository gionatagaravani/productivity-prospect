## Frequently Asked Questions


### How often should I perform digital decluttering?

I recommend performing a quick daily cleanup of emails and downloads, a weekly organization of current files and photos, and a monthly deep clean of all digital assets. This routine helps prevent overwhelming accumulation of digital clutter.



### What's the best way to organize digital photos?

I find that organizing photos by date and event in a consistent folder structure works best. Use tools like Google Photos or Adobe Lightroom for automatic categorization, facial recognition, and easy searching. Regular backups are essential.



### How can I maintain digital organization long-term?

Success in digital organization comes from creating sustainable habits and using automated tools. Set up automated filing systems, use cloud storage with good search capabilities, and schedule regular maintenance sessions. The key is to make organization part of your daily routine rather than a periodic major cleanup.



### Which cloud storage service offers the best value?

Based on my experience, Google Drive offers the best value for most users, with its 15GB free storage and reasonable paid plans. However, if you're already in the Microsoft ecosystem, OneDrive's integration with Windows and Office makes it a compelling choice. The best value depends on your specific needs and existing tech ecosystem.
