## Frequently Asked Questions


### How often should I review my SMART goals?

I recommend reviewing your SMART goals at least monthly, with weekly check-ins for short-term goals. This helps you stay on track and make necessary adjustments to your action plans.



### What makes a goal truly "SMART"?

A truly SMART goal incorporates all five elements: it's specific enough to understand exactly what needs to be done, has measurable metrics for tracking progress, is actually achievable with your current resources, remains relevant to your broader objectives, and includes a clear deadline.



### Can SMART goals be modified once set?

Absolutely! I always emphasize that SMART goals should be living documents. As circumstances change or you gain new insights, it's perfectly acceptable and often necessary to adjust your goals while maintaining their SMART characteristics.



### What's the ideal number of SMART goals to set at once?

Based on my experience, focusing on 3-5 SMART goals at a time is optimal. This allows you to maintain focus while still making progress across multiple areas of importance.
